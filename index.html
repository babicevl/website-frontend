				<p class="history"> In 2015, VICE launched Broadly, a website dedicated to covering gender and identity. Now, all the stories that touch these important issues will live on VICE.com. Bringing Broadly onto VICE means that what Broadly stands for, the issues it fights for, and the worldview it explores will not only continue, but will be amplified further.</p>

				<h2>Astrology</h2>
				<p>Whether the issue was reproductive health, LGBTQ rights, or weed, we put the people and communities impacted most at the center of our stories. Some of our favorite features are deep dives into topics that alarmed and intrigued us, like anti-abortion terrorism or the making of the Spice Girls movie.</p>

				<h2>The Gender Spectrum Collection</h2>
				<p>In collaboration with VICE.com, we created a stock photo library featuring nearly 200 images of trans and non-binary models that go beyond the clichés. This collection is available to the media for free, and aims to help the industry better represent members of these communities as people not necessarily defined by their gender identities.</p>

				<h2>This is Fine</h2>
				<p>Our Sunday newsletter tracks the specific ways we go about improving our days. Every week, a new contributor shares an essay about a strategy they employ to feel better, alongside annotations from members of Sad Girls Club, a community that focuses on mental health.</p>

				<h2>Forgotten Histories</h2>
				<p>We are committed to rewriting biased histories and recalling the lives of important women, non-binary, and queer people who have been otherwise erased from the history books. In columns like Myth Understood and History Of, we dove into the untold origins and lives of feudal Japan's women samurai, the tradition of wearing eyeliner, and icons like Eartha Kitt and Bessie Stringfield, among many others.</p>
