				<p class="history"> In 2015, VICE launched Broadly, a website dedicated to covering gender and identity. Now, all the stories that touch these important issues will live on VICE.com. Bringing Broadly onto VICE means that what Broadly stands for, the issues it fights for, and the worldview it explores will not only continue, but will be amplified further.</p>

				<p>Whether the issue was reproductive health, LGBTQ rights, or weed, we put the people and communities impacted most at the center of our stories. Some of our favorite features are deep dives into topics that alarmed and intrigued us, like anti-abortion terrorism or the making of the Spice Girls movie.</p>
